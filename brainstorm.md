-- Multiomics analysis   
‘Ome’ and ‘Omics’  

-- Terminology  
Cross omics (Pubmed=443 also getting hits to OMICS journal with cross used in abstract)  
Cross-omics (Pubmed=33)  
Crossomics (Pubmed=1)  
X-omics (Pubmed=12)  
Multi omics (Pubmed=1749)  
Multi-omics (Pubmed=1291)  
Multiomics (Pubmed=250)  
Vertical omics (Pubmed=20, From Hasin et al. 2017 does not seem to be used)  
Mixomics (Pubmed=18 An R package)  
Interactomics – interactome  
Integrative genomics  
Comparative genomics  
Integrative analysis  
Systems biology  
Enrichment analysis  
Integrative clustering  
Sequential analysis  
Integrative analysis  
Overrepresentation analyses (See Khatri et al. 2012: Ten Years of pathway analysis: current approaches and outstanding challenges)
See Ge et al. 2003: Integrating ‘omic’ information: a bridge between genomics and systems biology

-- Types of data

-- Analyses methods  

-- Specific methods  
- Combining dependent univariate test statistics (Rotroff & Motsinger-Reif 2016)
  
- Biological networks  
Weighted network analysis (Horvath 2011 Book)

- Andre Franke?

- Matrix-Matrix Distance based F-test (Kern et al Draft refers to Rühlemann et al. 2018)

- Diablo – Mixomics

- Hasin et al. 2017  
Summary data-based Mendelian randomization (176)  
Mediation analysis (177) (SNP vs gene expression data 45, 46, but also other 46, 47)  
Conditional analysis (23)  
Simple correlation  
Networks – ID conversion – pathway databases  
Networks – Interaction graphs (60-64)
